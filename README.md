This game is created as a part of the [Python Bootcamp](https://github.com/GrichSHiran/london-app-brewery-python-bootcamp-projects). 

## Installation
For this application, you don't need to install any additional package as [`turtle` library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) is a part of the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html).

Once you have cloned the project, you can directly run `main.py` and the game would work out of the box.

## Gameplay
Use paddle controls and try to block the pong ball off from reaching your side. Each time the ball lands on one side, the other side score one point. The first player to reach the score limit wins the game.

## Default Configuration
The default score limit is set to 3. The paddle up/down controls are `i` and `k` for the right-side player, `e` and `d` for the left-side player. You can customized the configuration directly on `main.py` through changing the top-level constants.
